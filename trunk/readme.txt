Multilingual websites with WordPress Multisite

== Description ==
By using the powerful WordPress Multilingual-Press plugin itÂ´s much easier to build multilingual sites and
run them with WordPress' multisite feature. To get going with this plugin, you need to setup a WordPress 
multisite installation first 
(check the Codex for more infos on this topic: http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network). 
Each site/blog can then be attributed to a different language. Simply write a post or page in one language 
and Multilingual-Press will automatically create a duplication of it in the other sites/blogs. These new 
posts and pages are interlinked and are easily accessible via the post/page editor screen - you can switch 
back and forth to translate them! Multilingual-Press is WordPress conform, easy to install and doesn't make 
any changes to the WordPress core. It doesn't harm your website's performance.
