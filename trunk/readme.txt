Multilingual websites with WordPress Multisite


== Description ==
By using the powerful WordPress Plugin Multilingual-Press itÂ´s much easier to build multilingual Sites and run them with WordPress Multisite Feature. For this Plugin you need to setup a WordPress Multisite. Each Site/Blog is a different language. It is an ease to write a post or page in one language and it will automatically create a post on the other Sites/Blogs. So all posts with the same content but different language are linked to each other. You just have to translate the content to the specific language. The Multilingual Press is WordPress conform, easy to install and doesn't make any changes to the WordPress Core. It doesn't harm your website performance.  

**Currently the Plugin is under development; pure alpha**

Please give us feedback, contribute and file technical bugs on [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/inpsyde/multilingual-press).

        reminder which posts you have to translate
