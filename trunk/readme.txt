Multilingual websites with WordPress Multisite


== Description ==
By using the powerful WordPress Multilingual-Press plugin itÂ´s much easier to build multilingual sites and
run them with WordPress' multisite feature. To get going with this plugin, you need to setup a WordPress 
multisite installation first 
(check the Codex for more infos on this topic: http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network). 
Each site/blog can then be attributed to a different language. Simply write a post or page in one language 
and Multilingual-Press will automatically create a duplication of it in the other sites/blogs. These new 
posts and pages are interlinked and are easily accessible via the post/page editor screen - you can switch 
back and forth to translate them! Multilingual-Press is WordPress conform, easy to install and doesn't make 
any changes to the WordPress core. It doesn't harm your website's performance.  

**Currently the plugin is under development; pure alpha. Before using this version of the plugin in your live 
site, we recommend you to install it in a testing environment and to backup your database and site/blog 
content**

Please give us feedback, contribute and file technical bugs on 
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/inpsyde/multilingual-press).

= Pro Version =
We will also have a pro version of this plugin, which includes these additional features and many more:

- browser language detection and automatically forwarding to the correct language (can be 
  deactivated via settings)
- creating a draft is activated by default (can be deactivated globaly via settings or in 
  metabox for specific posts)
- possibility to publish posts just on selected sites/blogs
- create new language -> copy of a complete site/blog:
        posts, links, attachments, categories, tags
        reminder which posts you have to translate
        custom table column with language
- duplicate sites/blogs and create links    
- frontend: cookies store which languages were selected
- easily switching to another language from your editor while editing a post
- global media library for all sites/blogs
- Dashboard widget in root blog displaying all posts which still have to be translated

**Currently in development**
