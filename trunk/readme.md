# Multilingual Press
Multilingual websites with WordPress Multisite

## Description
By using the powerful WordPress Multilingual-Press plugin itÂ´s much easier to build multilingual sites and
run them with WordPress' multisite feature. To get going with this plugin, you need to setup a WordPress 
multisite installation first 
(check the Codex for more infos on this topic: [Create_A_Network](http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network)). 
Each site/blog can then be attributed to a different language. Simply write a post or page in one language 
and Multilingual-Press will automatically create a duplication of it in the other sites/blogs. These new 
posts and pages are interlinked and are easily accessible via the post/page editor screen - you can switch 
back and forth to translate them! Multilingual-Press is WordPress conform, easy to install and doesn't make 
any changes to the WordPress core. It doesn't harm your website's performance.

### Pro Version
We will also have a pro version of this plugin, which includes these additional features and many more:

* browser language detection and automatically forwarding to the correct language (can be 
  deactivated via settings)
* creating a draft is activated by default (can be deactivated globaly via settings or in 
  metabox for specific posts)
* possibility to publish posts just on selected sites/blogs
* create new language -> copy of a complete site/blog:
        posts, links, attachments, categories, tags
        reminder which posts you have to translate
        custom table column with language
* duplicate sites/blogs and create links
