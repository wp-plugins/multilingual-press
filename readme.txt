Multilingual websites with WordPress Multisite

== Description ==

Connect multiple sites as language alternatives in a multisite. Use a customizable widget to link to all sites.


This plugin lets you connect an unlimited amount of sites with each other. Set a main language for 
each site, create relationships (connections), and start writing. You get a new field now to create 
a linked post on all the connected sites automatically.
The are accessible via the post/page editor screen - you can switch back and forth to translate them! 

In contrast to most other translation plugins there is **no lock-in effect**: When you disable our plugin, 
all sites will still work as separate sites without any data-loss or garbage output.

Note we cannot offer free ad hoc support.

= Free version =

- Set up unlimited blog relations in the site manager.
- View the translations for each post or page underneath the post editor.
- Show a list of links for all translations on each page in a flexible widget.
- No lock-in: After deactivation, all sites will still work.

= Pro Version =

Our [pro-version](http://marketpress.com/product/multilingual-press-pro/) offers many features to 
save your time and to improve your work flow and user experience:

- Support for custom post types.
- Automatically redirect to the user's preferred language version of a post.
- Edit all translations for a post from the original post editor without the need to switch sites.
- Duplicate blogs. Use one blog as template for new blogs, copy *everything:* Posts, attachments, 
  settings for plugins and themes, navigation menus, categories, tags and custom taxonomies.
- Synchronized trash: move all connected post to trash with one click.
- Quicklinks. Add links to language alternatives to a post automatically to the post content. This 
  is especially useful when you don't use widgets or a sidebar.
- User specific language settings for the back-end. Every user can choose a preferred language for 
  the user interface without affecting the output of the front-end.
- Show posts with incomplete translations in a dashboard widget.
