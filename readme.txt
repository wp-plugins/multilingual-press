Create networks with multiple languages

== Description ==

Connect multiple sites as language alternatives in a multisite. Use a
customizable widget to link to all sites.

This plugin lets you connect an unlimited amount of sites with each other.
Set a main language for each site, create relationships (connections), and start
writing. You get a new field now to create a linked post on all the connected
sites automatically.
They are accessible via the post/page editor screen - you can switch back and
forth to translate them.

In contrast to most other translation plugins there is **no lock-in effect**:
When you disable our plugin, all sites will still work as separate sites without
any data-loss or garbage output.

Our **Language Manager** offers 174 languages, and you can edit them.

We cannot guarantee free ad hoc support. Please be patient, we are a small team.
You can follow our progress and development notices on our
[developer blog](http://make.marketpress.com/multilingualpress/).

= Free version =

- Set up unlimited site relationships in the site manager.
- Language Manager with 174 editable languages.
- View the translations for each post or page underneath the post editor.
- Show a list of links for all translations on each page in a flexible widget.
- No lock-in: After deactivation, all sites will still work.

= Pro Version =

Our [pro-version](http://marketpress.com/product/multilingual-press-pro/) offers many features to
save your time and to improve your work flow and user experience:

- Support for custom post types.
- Automatically redirect to the user's preferred language version of a post.
- Edit all translations for a post from the original post editor without the need to switch sites.
- Duplicate sites. Use one site as template for new site, copy *everything:* Posts, attachments,
  settings for plugins and themes, navigation menus, categories, tags and custom taxonomies.
- Synchronized trash: move all connected post to trash with one click.
- Change relationships between translations or connect existing posts.
- Quicklinks. Add links to language alternatives to a post automatically to the post content. This
  is especially useful when you don't use widgets or a sidebar.
- User specific language settings for the back-end. Every user can choose a preferred language for
  the user interface without affecting the output of the front-end.
- Show posts with incomplete translations in a dashboard widget.


== Installation ==

= Requirements =
* WordPress Multisite 3.3+
* PHP 5.2.4, newer PHP versions will work faster.

Use the installer via back-end of your install or ...

1. Unpack the download-package.
2. Upload the files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the **Network/Plugins** menu in WordPress and click **Network Activate**.
4. Go to **All Sites**, **Edit** each site, then select the tab **Multilingual Press** to configure the
   settings. You need at least two sites with an assigned language.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will Multilingual Press translate my content? =

No, it will not. It manages relationships between sites and translations, but it doesn't change the content.

= Where can I get additional language files? =

You can find all official translation files in WordPress' [language repository](http://i18n.svn.wordpress.org/).

= Can I use Multilingual Press on a single-site installation? =

That would require changes to the way WordPress stores post content. Other plugins
do that; we think this is wrong, because it creates a lock-in: you would lose
access to your content after the plugin deactivation.
